// Explanation:
// This model involves learners in representing molecules cycling and changing through photosynthesis and respiration. The model involves a plant and a bunny, and a background that alternates between daytime and nighttime. The bunny breathes in oxygen and breathes out carbon dioxide, so when a learner-as-oxygen touches the bunny, they become carbon dioxide. If it is daytime, when a learner-as-carbon dioxide and a learner-as-water meet on the plants chloroplast, photosynthesis occurs and the carbon dioxide becomes sugar while the water becomes oxygen. Then, if the learner-as-sugar touches the plant's roots, they become water. When this happens, one of the plant's leaves (the left leaf) grows slightly, representing how photosynthesis creates sugars that enable the plant to grow. In this way, learners can rotate through the four types of molecules in the model. Note that in the starting state of the model, all learners are oxygen molecules, but there are \"molecule generators\" in the top right of the screen that enable them to switch to other molecule types before engaging with the rest of the model.
